# Yeastomics
Yeastomics gather a set of tools and functions I use to analyze yeast proteome data.

**SGD** is the reference for data related to _genome sequences_.
**UniprotKB** is the reference for _data related to proteome_.


## Sequence
read proteomes from list of files
read nucleic sequence 
read protein sequence

## Alignment
make pairwise alignment

## Phylogenetic
read Rate4site (R4S) output


## Published datasets (remote access via URL)
2014
Leueunberger et al., 2017
Van Leeuwen et al., 2020
Ho et al., 2018
Belle et al., 2006
Villen et al., 2017
Jackson et al., 2018

## Local datasets (E. Levy inhouse data)
3dcomplex
ppi INTACT (curated)
R4S data for fungi lineage
R4S data for 1011 yeast strains

## Analysis
make equal bins (1st and last bin manual)

## Utilities
String manipulations
Shorthands
Environment and memory
Counting
Filtering/Subsetting
Precomputed-data
